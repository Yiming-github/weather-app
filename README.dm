# Weather App

A simple weather application that allows users to search for weather conditions based on their location (city, zip code, etc.). 
The app fetches weather data (simulated for now) and displays the current weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a description of the weather (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy). 
The app also changes its background dynamically based on the current weather conditions.

## Features
- **Location and Weather Search**: Users can enter a location (city, zip code) and get real-time weather data.
- **Weather Details**: Displays the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.
- **Dynamic Background**: The background changes based on the weather condition (sunny, cloudy, rainy).
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and adapts to both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the basic structure of the app.
- **CSS**: Styles the app, making it responsive and applying dynamic background images based on weather conditions.
- **JavaScript**: Handles user interaction, simulates fetching weather data, and updates the UI with weather information.

## How to use 

Open the app.html file, and i didn't use API to fatch the realtime data, I just used the simulated data. The search box doesn't recoginse
the city, you can only change the weather by typing 'sunny', 'cloudy",etc. And the background will change as well. 

## About the Developer

This project was developed by Evan, a data science student who has recently started learning web development. 
While my background is in data science, I have been quickly picking up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to expand my skills. 
This project serves as an opportunity to challenge myself and apply the concepts I’ve learned so far. 
I’m excited to continue learning and improving my front-end development skills.
